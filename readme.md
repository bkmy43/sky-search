#Sky Search

##General Idea
This is a prototype for software, which would use skyline similarity based alghoritms for searching over high-dimentional data. In order to implement k-NN search we are going to use rankings over similarity skylines.

##Data
As a first test dataset we use data, which comes from Zalando Public API.

##Who we are
Currently a few people working in Zalando SE and one external software guru are contributing to the project.
Any contribution is very welcome!
